                            The '24h de l'info' are national competitions that take place every year at an IUT randomly selected.
                            Every student in 'BUT Informatique' is free to participate.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The 24 hours are split into 3 parts of 8 hours each. The first is about algorithms, the second
                            about web development, and the last one about cybersecurity/cryptography.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Each part of the competition is split in multiple exercises too. Succeeding in one grants you a specific
                            number of points, and the team which has gained the most points at the end of the 24 hours wins.

                        This year, our school at Villetaneuse has been chosen to organize the 24 hours competition.
                        From Friday 31st of May to Sunday 1st of June, 34 teams did their best to try to win.

                        We had the pleasure of organizing the event and its development. Let's go back in detail 
                        on how we did it.

                    <p class="text">
                        Everything started at the beginning of May, when we have been told that we would be 
                        in charge of organizing the event. Our class had been divided into 34 groups of 5 people,
                        and every group must realize many tasks such as creating a route sheet, a diary, and
                        displays.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">
                        The day before the event, we have set up the tables of every group that was participating.
                        The day of the event, before 2 p.m., we installed many power outlets in order to 
                        supply every group with power for their laptops. Then, we have welcomed them by 
                        gifting them stuff, and bringing them to the place where they stayed for the next
                        24 hours.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">
                        During the competition, our groups took turns to stay available for all the participants in case 
                        they had questions. We also organized the meals so the participants could eat whenever they want,
                        event during the night. We took advantage of their breaks to collect their feedbacks on the 
                        event and its organization. Finally, we took many photos to keep a record of the event.
