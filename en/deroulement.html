                    The 34 participating teams gathered in the Jackson Richardson gymnasium at the Université de
                    Villetaneuse to take part in this iconic event.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once they had settled in, their equipment out and plugged in, the 24h de l'info got under way with a presentation
                    of some of the organizers before the real thing began... the algorithm test.

                    <p>It is made up of 4 1st year students and one 2nd year student.</p>
                    <p>Their goal in coming here was to have fun and not finish last.</p>
                    <p>
                        They managed to accomplish their objective, since they finished 28th out 
                        of 34, despite having a laptop that stopped working.

                        Thanks to their experience obtained during their internships
                        and their good mood, they did a great job and finished 4th overall.
                    </p>
                    <p>They are happy to be part of this competition.</p>

                    In the end, it was the Synazes, the geek timbres, and Long-Fa Esport who finished first,
                    second, and third. They came from Calais, Vannes, and Maubeuge respectively.
